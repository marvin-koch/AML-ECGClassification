# ECG Classification - ETH Advanced Machine Learning 2023 Task 2
In this task, the first and most important part was to define the extract_features function which takes an ECG signal and returns a list of features which describes the signal.  To do that, we used the ecg function from biosppy.signals.ecg library. This function returns ts, filtered, rpeaks, templates_ts, templates, heart_rate_ts, heart_rate from our ECG signal. We then correct the rpeaks variable using the correctpeaks function from the same library, so that it corresponds to the sampling rate. Using rpeaks, we could extract the peaks of our ECG signal. We then created the feature list by calculating the max, min, mean and std of each variable, and also did the same for their differences. We then applied the extract_features function to each ECG signal in our data to create our new train and test data. 
In the next step, we preprocessed our new data. We first used the iterative imputer with n_nearest_features = 15 and then normalized the values with the robustscalar. We then removed all outliers using the z_score. We removed all points with z_score > 7. 
Using the cleaned data, we used the XGBClassifier to make our predictions, whos hyperparmeters we found using GridSearchCV. We also tried using the GaussianProcessClassifier and RandomForestClassifier, but the results weren't as good.
